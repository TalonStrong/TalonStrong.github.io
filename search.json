    "section": "",
    "text": "The talk around college football during the playoff era even when it was just 4 teams was how much does strength of schedule matter.\nFans, coaches, and analysts are always making a case about how much it should matter when looking at teams and deciding who should get in the playoff. A hard schedule can show who is actually the best and who has been battle tested throughout the season, while an easy schedule can help a team’s record without really proving they’re a good team. After a full season, strength of schedule can be the difference between teams that are pretenders and contenders.\nBut what I really want to know is how much does strength of schedule matter in terms of winning? Weather you’re a vastly talented team or a team with no talent, isn’t it just about playing who’s in front of you rather then their ranking? Does having a strong strength of schedule matter at the beginning of the season before anyone has played the games?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nshow_col_types = \"FALSE\"\nread_csv(\"Conference.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nsos_1 &lt;- read_csv(\"SOS_record.csv\",  show_col_types = FALSE)\nread_csv(\"Team SOS.csv\",  show_col_types = FALSE)\nread_csv(\"SOS_percent.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese were the top 12 teams with the hardest strength of schedule at the end of the 2024 college football season. 6 of these teams were in the Big Ten and 6 were in the SEC. Is that really surprising to anyone? No? Me neither, because those are the 2 best conferences in college football and will be for the foreseeable future. With those 2 conferences being the best that means teams in those conferences will have stronger strength of schedules and records.\nSome of those teams in the top 12 had abysmal records, including Purdue and Mississippi State who finished with a combined 3-21 record and didn’t win a conference game. Now those teams aren’t the most talented and you can see why they struggled but what about teams with a weaker strength of schedule in weaker conferences.\n\n\nCode\nSOS_1 &lt;- read.csv(\"SOS_record.csv\")\nSOS_2 &lt;- read.csv(\"SOS_percent.csv\")\n\ncombined_sos &lt;- full_join(SOS_1, SOS_2, by = \"Team\")\n\nteams &lt;- combined_sos |&gt;\n  filter (Team %in% c(\"Michigan\", \"Mississippi State\", \"Ohio State\", \"Georgia\", \"Alabama\", \"UCLA\", \"Purdue\", \"Texas\", \"Oklahoma\", \"Oregon\", \"Kentucky\", \"USC\", \"Tulsa\", \"Connecticut\", \"James Madison\", \"Louisiana Tech\", \"Hawaii\", \"Memphis\", \"Jacksonville State\", \"East Carolina\", \"San Jose State\", \"North Texas\", \"North Carolina\", \"Duke\", \"Kansas State\", \"Arizona State\", \"Clemson\", \"Georgia Tech\", \"Houston\", \"Utah\", \"Washington State\"))\n\nggplot(teams, aes(x = Tot_SOS, y = Tot_Pct)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1) + \n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = Team), size = 3, max.overlaps = Inf) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Did teams with a weaker SOS win more? \", subtitle = \"Tulsa played a weak schedule but had a terrible record\", caption = \"By Talon Strong| Source: Sports Reference\", \n    x = \"Strength of Schedule\",\n    y = \"Win Percentage\"\n  ) +\ntheme_minimal() +\ntheme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    panel.border = element_rect(linetype = \"solid\", fill = NA),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = \"grey\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve discussed the top 12 teams in terms of strength of schedule and how they were in the 2 best conferences but what about teams that aren’t in those juggernaut conferences? For those teams outside the Big Ten and SEC, strength of schedule becomes a different conversation. Lower conferences can often play weaker overall competition, which means their records can look better when they win. But some of these programs in weaker conferences still lose and lose often even with a weaker schedule.\nTulsa is in the American Conference and had one of the lower strength of schedule ratings yet they went 3-9 in 2024. Teams in the middle of the rating system like North Carolina and Arizona state had different seasons all together. North Carolina in the ACC went 6-7 and Arizona State won the Big 12 and had a first round bye in the College Football Playoff.\n\n\nCode\nteams_top &lt;- teams %&gt;% \n  slice(1:15)\nteams_bottom &lt;- teams %&gt;% \n  slice(16:31)\n\nmy_theme &lt;- theme(\n  title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n  plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n  panel.border = element_rect(linetype = \"solid\", fill = NA),\n  panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = \"grey\"),\n  axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n  plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n)\n\n p1 &lt;- ggplot(teams_top, \n       aes(y = reorder(Team, Tot_Pct),\n           x = OPPWIN,\n           xend = Tot_Pct)) +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    color = \"gray70\",\n    size = 1.5,\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"blue\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Team win percentage vs opponent win percentage\",\n    subtitle = \"Teams who had a higher opponent win percentage (red) lost more\", caption = \"By Talon Strong| Source: Sports Reference\", \n    x = \"Win Percentage\",\n    y = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   my_theme\n \n p2 &lt;- ggplot(teams_bottom, \n       aes(y = reorder(Team, Tot_Pct),\n           x = OPPWIN,\n           xend = Tot_Pct)) +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    color = \"gray70\",\n    size = 1.5,\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"blue\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"\", \n    subtitle = \"\", \n    x = \"Win Percentage\",\n    y = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n my_theme\n    \n p1+p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrength of schedule and opponent win percentage obviously can have an impact on winning and losing, but they are not perfect or the only aspects of a team’s record. Team’s facing stronger opponents week in and week out makes the season in whole more demanding and challenging. Those teams with tougher schedules will often take more of those losses because every week is always a test of will. At the same time, this does not explain everything. Every season, teams with high opponent win percentages or stronger strength of schedule still find ways to win and sometimes go undefeated. They finish strong because they have better talent, coaching, and depth on their side.\nThe teams with easier schedules and lower opponent win percentages still struggle because they lack the fundamentals of a good team. So all in all strength of schedule does matter in terms of a team’s ceiling and floor, but it is not an absolute direct correlation. There is so much more that goes into it then that but strength of schedule can always benefit a team in terms of wins and losses."

    "text": "Oklahoma finished the 2024 season at 6-7 and 2-6 in the SEC.\nThe Sooners had plenty of hype going into the 2024 season. Coming off a 10-3 season under head coach Brent Venables in 2023, it felt like the team had turned the corner. Losing Dillon Gabriel in the portal hurt, but with former five start quarterback Jackson Arnold waiting in the wings, optimism was high. Venables, know for churning out top 20 defenses since his time as the Clemson defensive coordinator, has kept up that success during his time with Oklahoma.\nThe problem with a Venables led Sooner team isn’t the defense, it’s the Offense. Oklahoma’s offense ranked near the bottom of a loaded SEC in terms of total yards. This is what kept the Sooners from being a real team, and instead made them look below average.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(cfbfastR)\nlibrary(ggtext)\ncfbd_team_info \nshow_col_types = \"FALSE\"\ndef &lt;- read_csv(\"Total_Defense.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\noff &lt;- read_csv(\"Total_Offense.csv\",  show_col_types = FALSE)\nsos &lt;- read_csv(\"Oklahoma_SOS.csv\",  show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nstats &lt;- cfbd_stats_season_team(year = 2024)\n\nsec &lt;- stats |&gt; \n  filter(conference == \"SEC\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_yds))\n\nou &lt;- sec |&gt; \n  filter(team == \"Oklahoma\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = sec, \n    aes( x = reorder(team, total_yds), weight=total_yds)\n    ) + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=ou, aes(x=reorder(team, total_yds), weight=total_yds), fill=\"darkred\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Oklahoma Struggles to Move the Ball on Offense\", subtitle = \"The Sooners ranked 3rd worst in total yards in the conference during the 2024 season\", caption = \"By Talon Strong| Source: cfbfastR\", \n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Total Yards\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    panel.border = element_rect(linetype = \"solid\", fill = NA),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = \"grey\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOklahoma was never a threat on the offensive side to put fear into elite defenses in the SEC. Oklahoma lost faith in a quarterback who was supposed to lead them to glory after just one loss to Tennessee. Jackson Arnold lost a lot of confidence after that and Michael Hawkins Jr. wasn’t much of a threat through the air. Eventually Oklahoma turned back to the former five star but there wasn’t a fix.\nAfter that it felt like the Sooners were doomed. Failing to capitalize with that much talent on the offensive side felt like a waste of a year.\n\n\nCode\nsec_teams &lt;- c(\"Alabama\", \"Arkansas\", \"Auburn\", \"Florida\", \"Georgia\", \"Kentucky\", \"LSU\", \"Mississippi State\", \"Missouri\", \"Oklahoma\", \"Ole Miss\", \"South Carolina\", \"Tennessee\", \"Texas\", \"Texas A&M\", \"Vanderbilt\")\nsec_off &lt;- off |&gt; filter(School %in% sec_teams) \nsec_def &lt;- def |&gt; filter(School %in% sec_teams) \n  sec &lt;- sec_off |&gt;\n  select(School, PPG = Pts) |&gt;\n  inner_join(\n    sec_def |&gt; select(School, Opp_PPG = OppPts),\n    by = \"School\"\n  )\n  OU &lt;- sec |&gt; filter(School == \"Oklahoma\")\n  \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = sec,\n    aes(y = reorder(School, PPG), x = Opp_PPG, xend = PPG),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"green\"\n  ) + \ngeom_dumbbell(\n    data = OU,\n    aes(y = reorder(School, PPG), x = Opp_PPG, xend = PPG),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"darkred\",\n    colour_x = \"darkred\",\n    colour_xend = \"darkred\"\n  )+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Oklahoma's Defense was Elite\",\n    subtitle = \"Oklahoma's Offense (Right) Had Problems Taking Advabntage of the Stops Their Defense (Left) Provided\",\n    x =\"Difference Between Defensive and Offensive Points Per Game\", \n    y = \"\",\n    caption = \"By: Talon Strong | Source: Sports Reference\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face= \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=10),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo now that we’ve seen how abysmal the offense was at moving the ball, let’s take a look at the comparison between the Sooners’ on both sides.\nYes, as I’ve suspected. the defense was fantastic at slowing down the opposing team’s offense, allowing under 22 points per game. The Offense could never find enough rhythm to put points on the board to help out. Oklahoma rarely got blown out last year but they weren’t exactly lighting up the scoreboard either. This Oklahoma defense gave them every opportunity to win more then six games on the year and more then two in the conference.\nWhen your offense fails to score over 25 points per game in this day an age, in one of the best conferences in the country, look to be mediocre in the win column.\n\n\nCode\nOU &lt;- sos\nOU$Bubble_Size &lt;- max(OU$Rank) - OU$Rank + 1\nOU$SOS &lt;- as.numeric(OU$SOS)\nOU$OPPWIN &lt;- as.numeric(OU$OPPWIN)\nOU$Bubble_Size &lt;- as.numeric(OU$Bubble_Size)\n\nteams_to_label &lt;- c(\"Oklahoma\", \"Michigan\", \"Ohio State\", \"Georgia\", \"Alabama\", \"TCU\", \"Tulsa\", \"FIU\", \"USC\", \"Syracuse\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = OU,\n    aes(x = SOS, y = OPPWIN, size = Bubble_Size),\n    color = \"grey60\",\n    alpha = 0.4\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = OU %&gt;% filter(Team == \"Oklahoma\"),\n    aes(x = SOS, y = OPPWIN, size = Bubble_Size),\n    color = \"darkred\",\n    alpha = 0.9\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = OU %&gt;% filter(Team %in% teams_to_label),\n    aes(x = SOS, y = OPPWIN, label = Team),\n    size = 3,\n    fontface = \"bold\", \n     max.overlaps = Inf\n  ) +\n  scale_size_continuous(range = c(3, 15)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Strength of Schedule\",\n    y = \"Opponent Win Percentage\",\n    title = \"Oklahoma Played One of the Toughest Schedules in the Nation\",\n    subtitle = \"With Their Opponent Win Percentage over .630 it's Easy to See Why They Struggled\",\n    size = \"Inverted Rank\", \n    caption = \"By: Talon Strong | Source: Warren Nolan\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face= \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=10),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOklahoma played one of the toughest schedules in the nation a season ago and still found a way to come up with six wins. Now four of those did come in non conference play but hey six wins is six wins right? The Sooners played a loaded conference schedule much like every other SEC team but they did take down a highly ranked Alabama Crimson Tide in dominant fashion. Well their defense was dominate, only giving up 3 points in the contest.\nThat’s exactly what makes this team so fascinating. They had a top 30 defense but won only six games. They were better then what the record shows and if the 2025 season has shown us anything through 10 games, it’s that if they had a competitive offense they would have surpassed the win total they finished with in the 2024 season.\nThe 2024 Oklahoma Sooners will go down as a what could of or what should of been with that terrific defense."
